<p>This project is part of a series of interfaces that I intend to implement as part of my portfolio. My main intention is to be able to improve and demonstrate my skills in using the main technologies that I am able to contribute to projects.</p>
<p>In this project, use only two technologies used for web development. The idea is to be able to show a trail of my evolution and thus prove good methodologies and project patterns with the aim of being able to produce rich and easy-to-maintain interfaces.</p>
